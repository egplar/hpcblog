# Technical information about the MI250x GPU

## Raw floating point capabilities

This table compares the raw technical specifications of one GPU die ("GCD") in the MI250x GPU package with some Nvidia GPUs. The GCD is what appears as 1 GPU when you run on the compute node, so this is what makes most sense to compare with when doing benchmarking. Please note that AMD, in its marketing, often refers to the MI250x package with 2 GCDs as "1 GPU", which might be misleading. 

| Spec                    | V100   | A100  | MI250x (1 GCD)   | 
| :---------------------- | -----: | ----: | ---------------: | 
| Vector FP64 (TF)        | 7.8    | 9.7   | 23.9             | 
| Vector FP32 (TF)        | 15.7   | 19.5  | 23.9             | 
| Vector FP16 (TF)        | 31.4   | 78.0  | 191.5            | 
| Matrix FP64 (TF)        | 7.8    | 19.5  | 47.9             | 
| Matrix FP32 (TF)        | 15.7   | 156.0 | 47.9             | 
| Matrix FP16 (TF)        | 125.0  | 312.0 | 191.5            | 
| Matrix BF16 (TF)        | 125.0  | 312.0 | 191.5            | 
| Memory bandwidth (TB/s) | 1.1    | 2.0   | 1.6              | 

These numbers give a rough estimation of what kind of performance you can expect (or should aim for) when porting Nvidia CUDA applications to AMD GPUs:

* If the code is limited by memory bandwidth you are likely to see the same or somewhat lower performance per GPU, if you compare 1 GCD to 1 A100.
* If the code uses FP64 math, like many traditional scientific simulations, there is a potential for 2x speedup vs 1 A100, but you may struggle to realize this performance due to the available memory bandwidth.
* If the code uses FP32 math, the performance should be about even, +/- 25% or so.
* If the code uses low-precision matrix operations (e.g. machine learning), the performance is likely to be lower per GPU.

All in all, I consider 1 MI250x GCD to be roughly equal to 1 A100, as an easy rule of thumb. If you can get results like that, you are probably in a good spot already with respect to optimization.
