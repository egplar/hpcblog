## About me

HPC application expert at the Parallel Computing Centre at Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. I work in the LUMI User Support Team, helping scientists make the best out [LUMI](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/), one of the European pre-exascale supercomputers and currently the #3 supercomputer in the world.

Previously, I worked at Atos in Germany in the HPC division, and at the National Supercomputer Centre in Link√∂ping, Sweden. I have background in computational materials science, so you can find some information about scientific software for density functional theory (DFT) calculations here.
