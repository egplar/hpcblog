# Blog source code

This is the source code used to generate my blog/online HPC notes at [hpc-notes.pages.dev](https://hpc-notes.pages.dev/). It is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

You may find "unpublished" texts in various branches besides the main branch. Anything there might be unreliable and/or in an unfinished state. Please rely on it only with extra care.
